1.Set up a Github Repo for this project. Follow the instructions atop the Google Homepage project if you need help. *

2.Set up a blank HTML document *

3.Think about how you would set up the different elements within the game. What objects and functions will you need? A few minutes of thought can save you from wasting an hour of coding.
    2 players object, name, action, type, status
    1 array to record board.
    1 function to check win.
    1 render function to create html element.



4.Create a basic 3x3 board object in Javascript that lists the current item in each space on the board (e.g. "X", "O", or " "). *

5.Create a render() function which cycles through that board object and creates the appropriate HTML elements. Style them to look like a real tic-tac-toe board. *

6.Build the main game logic (we won't give too many hints here). When the user clicks on a blank square, it should show the current player's symbol. This can be triggered by listening for a click event on the appropriate div. It may be helpful to give each div a data attribute or id based on its position so you can identify it in your JS code.

7.The game logic should then check whether the game is over -- if any player has achieved victory or if there are no more turns available. In the event of victory or defeat, display an appropriate message on the screen.

8.Optional -- switch out the "X" and "O" letters with appropriate (or funny) images.
